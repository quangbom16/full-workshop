### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at the AWS Vietnam office is professional and well-organized. The workspace provides all necessary equipment and infrastructure for technical work. Team members maintain a collaborative atmosphere that supports learning and problem-solving. The office layout also facilitates both focused individual work and team collaboration when needed.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
The mentor provided technical guidance on AWS services, cloud architecture, and DevOps practices. Questions were addressed with clear explanations and relevant documentation. The mentor encouraged hands-on learning through practical tasks and real-world scenarios. Support from mentors via the WhatsApp group ensured that members always had smooth access to necessary resources and tools throughout the internship period.

**3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major**  
The internship tasks were highly relevant to the curriculum of my **Information Security** and **Computer Science** major. Working with AWS infrastructure, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines allowed me to directly apply theoretical knowledge of cloud computing, system architecture, and software development. This experience bridged the gap between academic learning and practice in a real-world environment.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
The internship provided exposure to industry-standard tools and practices, including Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), AWS services (EC2, ALB, Auto Scaling, DynamoDB), DevOps workflows, and system architecture design. Participating in technical workshops on AI/ML, DevOps, and Security expanded my knowledge beyond the scope of the assigned project. These experiences developed both my technical competencies and professional working skills for the future.

**5. Company Culture & Team Spirit**  
The company culture is very positive. Everyone operates with a spirit of sharing, ready to support and provide constructive feedback on new ideas. Team members collaborate effectively on projects and share expertise across different technical domains. The series of workshops and community events demonstrate **AWS FCJ**'s commitment to fostering a learning environment. Mutual respect and growing together were the highlights of my OJT period at AWS.

**6. Internship Policies / Benefits**  
The internship program provided hands-on tools to work with AWS infrastructure and apply them to real projects, which significantly enhanced my ability to absorb new knowledge. Access to AWS workshops, technical resources, and community events offered valuable knowledge and continuous learning opportunities.
