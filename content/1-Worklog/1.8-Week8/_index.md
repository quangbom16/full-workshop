### Week 8 Objectives:

* Configure the local development environment for testing purposes.
* Refine the User Interface (UI) and restructure the Frontend codebase.
* Strengthen networking knowledge (CCNA) to support cloud configuration.
* Perform dry runs to verify application configuration and basic logic on the local machine.

### Tasks to be carried out this week:
