### Week 4 Achievements:

* Successfully defined the project scope and main idea.

* Gained a solid understanding of how web applications operate, including the flow from the user's browser to the backend server.

* Researched and selected the most suitable AWS services for the project (balancing cost and performance).

* Completed the preliminary Architectural Diagram (Draft 1), clearly visualizing the interaction between components such as VPC, EC2/Lambda, Database, and Load Balancers.
