- Understanding the trade-offs between performance, cost, and latency.

**Prompt Engineering Techniques**
- Best practices for interacting with LLMs.
- Advanced techniques: **Chain-of-Thought (CoT)** reasoning and **Few-shot learning** to improve model accuracy.

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Architecture deep dive: Connecting LLMs with external data sources.
- Integration with Knowledge Bases to reduce hallucinations and provide up-to-date information.

**Bedrock Agents & Guardrails**
- **Agents**: Creating multi-step workflows and integrating with external tools/APIs to perform tasks.
- **Guardrails**: Implementing safety filters and content moderation to ensure responsible AI usage.

**Live Demo: Building a Generative AI Chatbot**
- Step-by-step guide to building a functional chatbot using Amazon Bedrock.

### Key Takeaways

#### ML & GenAI Strategy

- **Model Selection Matters**: Choosing the right Foundation Model (Claude vs. Llama vs. Titan) depends heavily on the specific use case and budget.
- **RAG is Essential**: For enterprise applications, RAG is crucial to provide context-aware and accurate responses based on proprietary data.
- **Safety First**: Implementing Guardrails is non-negotiable for production GenAI applications to prevent harmful output.

#### Technical Architecture

- **SageMaker as the Hub**: Serves as the central nervous system for traditional ML models (Predictive AI).
- **Bedrock as the GenAI Layer**: Provides a serverless, API-based abstraction to access powerful FMs without managing infrastructure.
- **Agents for Action**: Moving beyond simple text generation to executing tasks (API calls, data lookups) using Bedrock Agents.

#### Operational Excellence

- **Prompt Engineering as a Skill**: It is a critical capability for developers to extract the best performance from LLMs.
- **MLOps**: Continuous integration and deployment are vital for maintaining model relevance and performance over time.

### Applying to Work

- **Implement RAG**: Build internal knowledge search tools using Amazon Bedrock and Knowledge Bases to help employees find information faster.
- **Develop Smart Agents**: Use Bedrock Agents to automate customer service tasks or internal workflows.
- **Standardize ML Workflows**: Migrate ad-hoc ML experiments to Amazon SageMaker pipelines for better governance and reproducibility.
- **Adopt Guardrails**: Review current GenAI applications and apply Bedrock Guardrails to ensure compliance and safety.
- **Optimize Costs**: Evaluate the usage of different Foundation Models to balance between capability and cost.

### Event Experience

Attending the **"AI/ML/GenAI on AWS Workshop"** was a highly practical and forward-looking experience. The session effectively bridged the gap between traditional Machine Learning and the cutting-edge world of Generative AI. Key experiences included:

- The **SageMaker Studio walkthrough** clarified how to manage the complex lifecycle of ML models in a single interface.
- The deep dive into **Amazon Bedrock** was particularly valuable, especially the comparison between models like **Claude and Llama**, which helped clarify when to use which model.
- Learning about **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** changed my perspective on how to make LLMs useful for business-specific data without retraining models.
- The session on **Bedrock Agents** opened up new possibilities for building applications that can actually *do* things, not just *say* things.

#### Leveraging modern AI tools
- Explored **Prompt Engineering** techniques like Chain-of-Thought to improve reasoning in AI responses.
- Discovered how **Guardrails** can be configured to filter out inappropriate content automatically.
- Witnessed the speed of building a **GenAI Chatbot** live, demonstrating the rapid development cycle possible with AWS tools.

#### Lessons learned
- **Context is King**: RAG is the most effective way to bring organizational knowledge into AI.
- **Don't reinvent the wheel**: Use managed services like Bedrock instead of hosting your own LLMs unless absolutely necessary.
- **Security & Safety**: These should be designed into GenAI applications from day one using Guardrails, not added as an afterthought.

Overall, the workshop provided a clear roadmap for adopting both predictive ML (SageMaker) and generative AI (Bedrock) within an organization, backed by relevant local context from the Vietnam market.
