During my internship at **AWS First Cloud Journey** from **09/08/2025** to **12/09/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in **designing and deploying a Malware Analysis System on AWS**, through which I improved my skills in **programming, software architecture, AWS services, CI/CD tools, and teamwork**.
